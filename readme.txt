To install, place the ck2 solar system folder and .mod file into Documents->Paradox Interactive->Crusader Kings II->mod. Now launch Crusader Kings 2, and select 'Cyber Kings: Solar System' in the mod options.
Trying to launch the mod without using the Random World setting available through the Holy Fury DLC will crash the game.
(Instructions: at the bookmark screen choose Custom Game Setup, and select the Randomize World button between the Year and the Merchant Republic list. If it does not work for you try using the pre-populated options as I was not able to test every possible combination of Random World options).

Backstory:
Long ago, Earth went dark on the same day all existing electronics in the solar system stopped working. All ships not in orbit fell from the sky.
Humanity quickly descended into chaos as society collapsed, bringing on a new Dark Age. Most of the population succumbed to famine as governments broke down and nations fractured.
Around 1000 years later the Earth and other nearby worlds are recovering and have entered a new Medieval Era, largely forgetting the accurate history of humanity and the disaster. 
Knowledge of the off-world colonies has faded into myths and legends, until one day a derelict ship, carrying a strange elongated race that cannot survive in the gravity well of Earth, 
arrived in orbit, offering to transport the Earthlings on trips of conquest to nearby planets in exchange for basic supplies and goods.

Lite Sci Fi features such as cybernetics and cloning available through the offmap empire are from the Middle Mars mod, with assets from the ck2 Sci-Fi full conversion mod COTC with permission from Galle the creator (who all us gave us permission to use some of his earlier work too)
