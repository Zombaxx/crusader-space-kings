BM_WP;Feudal Solar System;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_WP_INFO;Long ago, Earth went dark on the same day all existing electronics in the Solar System stopped working. All ships not in orbit fell from the sky. Humanity quickly descended into chaos as society collapsed, bringing on a new Dark Age. Most of the population succumbed to famine as governments broke down and nations fractured. Around 1000 years later the Earth and other nearby terraformed worlds are recovering and have entered a new Medieval Era, largely forgetting the accurate history of humanity and the disaster. Knowledge of the off-world colonies has faded into myths and legends, until one day a derelict ship, carrying a strange elongated race that cannot survive in the gravity well of a planet's surface, arrived in orbit, offering to transport the humans of the many worlds of the Solar System on trips of conquest to nearby planets in exchange for basic supplies and goods. This technologically advanced but politically neutral faction, which had voyaged from the neighboring star system of Tau Ceti in a generational colony ship, would eventually become known as the Spacer's Guild.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

This technologically advanced but politically neutral faction, which had voyaged from the neighboring star system of Tau Ceti in a generational colony ship, would eventually become known as the Spacer's Guild to the native rulers of the Solar System and would hold a monopoly on the services of interplanetary travel, cybernetic augmentation, and cloning for many centuries, leading to a system where ground warfare is common between the many habitable worlds yet no aerial combat occurs between space fairing vessels that transport the troops.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#ERA_CHAR_NAME_102265;Do not start as this character.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#ERA_CHAR_INFO_102265;Instead of pressing Start Game, choose Custom Game Setup at the bottom middle of your screen followed by the Random World button near the top right between the start year and the Merchant Republic list (Random World generation requires the Holy Fury DLC), or use the provided save file.

#ERA_CHAR_INFO_108275;The new update as of 3/8/2023 breaks old save files. If you wish to continue an old save file, visit our Discord server. This is the first test of a working bookmark for Solar System so that random world mode is no longer required. The number of cultures will be increased and borders for the various map modes will be adjusted, names within all map mode types are in development and subject to change. Province density and locations will be regenerated at least one more time which will break old saves again a future update. Please let us know on Discord if you have any feedback before the final map version is generated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_NAME_108275;Venus;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_108275;The location of a Catholic colony established during Venusnam, the unspoken interplanetary proxy war of influence between the USA and USSR at the end of the Space Race that resulted in a tragedy on Earth’s twin planet decades before the Great Disaster, which would ultimately destroy all advanced technology in the Solar System again, sending humanity back to the dark age it is now in. With the discovery of space habitats and rockets that can reach other worlds, the nations efforts had quickly resulted in a Cold War of influence over the already inhabited yet primitive worlds of Sol. Now with the remaining oppressors having been cut off from their home world and pushed out of all regions except the sole Catholic island in the north near the pirate outpost, the humid jungle planet of Venus is nearly free to play out its natural course between the two tribal pagan religions and the many seemingly Dharmist beliefs of the planet’s separate feudal caste system. Some say that deep within the jungles on Venus lies an endless ornate tunnel that should be avoided unless one wishes to lose his army in the Veil. If the Catholics can manage to expand their influence to the Pope of Earth, they may hope to turn the gaze of his Crusades toward Venus.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#ERA_CHAR_NAME_;Galilean Moons;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#ERA_CHAR_INFO_;The great sultan of Jupiter’s Zensunni has recaptured his ancestral lands from infidel hands. With the Kingdoms in danger, the great leaders of the moon of Europa prepare to embark to the Holy Land on the largest crusade ever. The Christian kingdoms of the three galilean moons reach a stalemate against the Zensunni, as the powerful Shia rise from within Ganymede and Callisto with the declared intent of halting the Christian invasion, guiding the strayed Zensunni back to their roots, and returning Al-Jupitalus to its former glory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#ERA_CHAR_NAME_;Mercury's Nile;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#ERA_CHAR_INFO_;Deep in the Upper Nile of Egypt lies a seemingly endless ornate tunnel. The Upper Nile region of Mercury contains a mysteriously similar tunnel, and the tribal inhabitants of the nearby great deserts still follow the their own form of the ancient ways of the polytheistic Kemetic gods. Shortly after the arrival of the Celestial Space Fleet the endless tunnel suddenly transformed into what look more like a liquid mirror, only the other side seemed to be a continuation of the surrounding environment but with an abrupt change at the boundary, perhaps at a different time in history. On closer inspection, it was in fact a Jump Gate that had been reactivated, a stabilized accelerating contraption between a hole punched in the space itself between the separate Nile regions on Earth and Mercury. With the former feudal realms of their gods now under control of blasphemous dualistic religions on both sides of the gate, the tribes of Mercury’s expansive deserts now have an alternate route to restore the lands of their heritage from either Nile region to Kemetic control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#ERA_CHAR_INFO_;The largest and only terraformed moon of Saturn, as well as the second-largest natural satellite in the Solar System, Titan is a world of dualities, containing Promethean and Hyperion tribal nations in the majority savannah southern continent, and nomadic Neanderthals, Habilis, and other relatives to the sapien cultures in the garden of the north continent. Will the proto humans manage pass the veil to the stars as their cousins the Sapiens did long ago, or will the Titan gatekeepers continue to enact their brutal and stifling customs across the planet for eons?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_NAME_112385;Olympians of Mars;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_112385;After the United Empire of Mars collapsed in the wake of the immortal emperor’s exile after the Spacer Imprisonment, the rulers of Mount Olympus quickly claimed Alba, and Tharsis once again, with sights on the Valles Marineris and the Argre. Will their Christian subjects meekly allow the rule of the Olympians to continue uniting the lands in the name of pagan gods, or will rebellions see the restoration of the Christian kingdoms of the Western Hemisphere of Mars?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_NAME_113075;Valles Marineris of Mars;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_113075;Although the Terraformed Caliphate had not survived in the long run after the conquest of Western Argyre and Valles Marineris over 400 years ago, their legacy remains as pockets of their people and independent Terraformed warlords continue their reign of the once Singularitan land, though with the Olympian Empire consolidating the lands to the west they will need to combine their forces or venture into the shattered Celestial lands on the polar land bridge to the south of the Argyre Sea to have any hope of keeping the importance of the Colonists Code at the forefront of minds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#ERA_CHAR_NAME_;Celestial Migrants;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#ERA_CHAR_INFO_;The ashes of the first Celestial migrant wave from the derelict spaceship to Mars from centuries ago begins to consolidate as the rest of the fractured generational spacefleet arrives centuries late and begins making contact with the planet, but still face decades of internal strife before hope of any real lasting alliance could be reached in the once beacon of the Celestial Empire on Mars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#ERA_CHAR_NAME_;Tharsis Mons;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#ERA_CHAR_INFO_;An unlikely ambitious tactician rises to the rank of strategist as the province of Pavonis containing the second linked Space Elevator falls back into Celestial control after winning the conquest against the Olympians in a multi century war to control the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_NAME_101415;United States of America;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_101415;The United States has dubiously survived the Great Disaster, but as tensions between the Muricans and Liblanders begin to rise once again turmoil appears to lie around the corner. Will the President, who had been ruling via decree of a continued State of Emergency for decades, prevail in calming the masses, or will the once mighty empire be fractured, allowing opportunity to those who dare to take it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_NAME_105115;European Union;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_105115;The many countries of the decentralized  European Union with full council authority grow restless with the dawn of this new dark age. Is greater authority needed to keep the peace and prevent the outer empires from encroaching on the continent, or is true independence for many of the member states on the horizon as a new age of feudal realms is ushered in? With the threat of the Eurasian Khan at the alliance’s eastern borders, the decision may have more impact on the balance of Earth than their ambitious policial leaders realize.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#ERA_CHAR_NAME_107175;Eurasia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#ERA_CHAR_INFO_107175;When the Cyborgs and their Spacer subservience first descended from the Himalayan space elevator, which China owned, China was surprised to learn these beings were from a very literal Celestial Empire, seemingly ruled by the literal Jade Emperor of legends that China’s own Emperors had always spoke of being descended from. China, soon found itself taken under the wing of their long lost family, gaining unimagined technological wonders, knowledge, and security at the cost of agreeing to pay tribute and to help the Celestial in battle. Soon they grew to posses a larger portion of Eursia and declared themselves the new Khanate after venturing into the Steppe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_NAME_101105;Brazil;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_101105;Shattered in the wake of the Great Disaster, the independent realms of the once sprawling Latin nation have many opportunities from the varied geography within the six major regions of the land. Can the nation of Brazil be restored to it’s true borders, or will the many nation states and tribes prevail in dividing the land until foreign influence looms at our door. As the Pope signals a new era of Crusades the answer could lie in the influence gained by the brilliance of a military commander.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#ERA_CHAR_NAME_;The Corporations;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#ERA_CHAR_INFO_;The endless quarterly profit goals of corporations largely drove the rise of the accelerated pre disaster development, but even with the total destruction of all advanced technology, the corporate elite were ready to weather the storm. Now that the storm has finally lifted, or at least reached the eye, with the United States and European Union miraculously intact, the Board begins to wonder if the common people would be better off under the total unregulated rule of corporate overlords rather than a failed federation, and more importantly what this could mean for their shareholders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
