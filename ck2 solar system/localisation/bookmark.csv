#BM_WP;Feudal Solar System;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#BM_WP_INFO;Long ago, Earth went dark on the same day all existing electronics in the Solar System stopped working. All ships not in orbit fell from the sky. Humanity quickly descended into chaos as society collapsed, bringing on a new Dark Age. Most of the population succumbed to famine as governments broke down and nations fractured. Around 1000 years later the Earth and other nearby terraformed worlds are recovering and have entered a new Medieval Era, largely forgetting the accurate history of humanity and the disaster. Knowledge of the off-world colonies has faded into myths and legends, until one day a derelict ship, carrying a strange elongated race that cannot survive in the gravity well of a planet's surface, arrived in orbit, offering to transport the humans of the many worlds of the Solar System on trips of conquest to nearby planets in exchange for basic supplies and goods. This technologically advanced but politically neutral faction, which had voyaged from the neighboring star system of Tau Ceti in a generational colony ship, would eventually become known as the Spacer's Guild.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

BM_WP_INFO;Decades ago, Earth went dark on the same day all existing electronics in the Solar System stopped working. All ships not in orbit fell from the sky. Humanity quickly descended into chaos as society collapsed, bringing on a new Dark Age. Most of the population succumbed to famine as governments broke down and nations fractured. Until one day a derelict ship, carrying a strange elongated race that cannot survive in the gravity well of a planet's surface, arrived in orbit, offering to transport the humans of the many worlds of the Solar System on trips of conquest to nearby planets in exchange for basic supplies and goods. This technologically advanced but politically neutral faction, which had voyaged from the neighboring star system of Tau Ceti in a generational colony ship to investigate why the ancient proto-civilizations of Sol had gone dark to communications many millennia ago, would eventually become known as the Spacer's Guild to the native rulers of the Solar System and would hold a monopoly on the services of interplanetary travel, cybernetics, and cloning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#ERA_CHAR_INFO_108275;The new update as of 3/8/2023 breaks old save files. If you wish to continue an old save file, visit our Discord server. This is the first test of a working bookmark for Solar System so that random world mode is no longer required. The number of cultures will be increased and borders for the various map modes will be adjusted, names within all map mode types are in development and subject to change. Province density and locations will be regenerated at least one more time which will break old saves again a future update. Please let us know on Discord if you have any feedback before the final map version is generated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_NAME_108275;Colonists of Venus;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_108275;With the discovery of space habitats and rockets by the people of Earth that can reach other worlds in the decades prior to the Great Disaster that would ultimately destroy all modern technology, sending humanity back to the dark ages it is in today, a Cold War during an era of colonization occured when the already inhabited yet primitive worlds of Sol were discovered during the Space Race. Now with the remaining oppressors having been cut off from their home world and pushed out of all regions except the Shinto and Catholic islands in the north near the pirate outpost, the humid jungle planet of Venus is nearly free to play out its natural course between the three tribal Druids, Solarians, and Animists, as well as the many seemingly Dharmist beliefs of the planet's separate nomadic neanderthal caste system.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#ERA_CHAR_INFO_108275;The location of a Catholic colony established during Venusnam, the unspoken interplanetary proxy war of influence between the USA and USSR at the end of the Space Race that resulted in a tragedy on Earth's twin planet decades before the Great Disaster, which would ultimately destroy all advanced technology in the Solar System again, sending humanity back to the dark age it is now in. With the discovery of space habitats and rockets that can reach other worlds, the nations efforts had quickly resulted in a Cold War of influence over the already inhabited yet primitive worlds of Sol. Now with the remaining oppressors having been cut off from their home world and pushed out of all regions except the sole Catholic island in the north near the pirate outpost, the humid jungle planet of Venus is nearly free to play out its natural course between the two tribal pagan religions and the many seemingly Dharmist beliefs of the planet's separate feudal caste system. Some say that deep within the jungles on Venus lies an endless ornate tunnel that should be avoided unless one wishes to lose his army in the Veil. If the Catholics can manage to expand their influence to the Pope of Earth, they may hope to turn the gaze of his Crusades toward Venus.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x


ERA_CHAR_NAME_121585;Caliph of the Galilean Moons;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_121585;The great sultan of Jupiter's Zensunni has recaptured his ancestral lands from infidel hands. With the Kingdom in danger, the great leaders of the moon of Europa prepare to embark to the Holy Land on the largest crusade ever. The Gnostic Christian kingdoms of the three Galilean moons reach a stalemate against the Zensunni, as the powerful True Triarchy of the Celestial Protectorate rise on central Ganymede with the declared intent of halting the Christian invasion, guiding the strayed Zensunni back to their roots, and returning Al-Jupitalus to its former glory as the pleroma.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#ERA_CHAR_INFO_;The largest and only terraformed moon of Saturn, as well as the second-largest natural satellite in the Solar System, Titan is a world of dualities, containing Promethean and Hyperion tribal nations in the majority savannah southern continent, and nomadic Neanderthals, Habilis, and other relatives to the sapien cultures in the garden of the north continent. Will the proto humans manage pass the veil to the stars as their cousins the Sapiens did long ago, or will the Titan gatekeepers continue to enact their brutal and stifling customs across the planet for eons?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_NAME_112385;Olympians of Mars;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_112385;When the rovers first arrived to Mars they confirmed what the few spacefaring nations of Earth had already feared yet kept secret from the public, that like the Moon, other worlds beyond Earth were also already home to vast cultures of other exotic humans, separated from Earth during pre-history in an interplanetary civilization-ending calamity. After the Lunar Independence Rebellion succeeded in 1972  shortely before the loss of the Venusnam War, the United States remained unable to continue to fund new colonization efforts offworld, until the elite of the private sector funded the mission for their own benefit. In the wake of the Great Disaster, neo-feudalism crept in faster than expected, with the former corporation now run as a vast empire stretching from Mount Olympus to Valles Mareneris. The native Olympians begin to plot rebellion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_NAME_101415;United States of America;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_101415;The United States has dubiously survived the Great Disaster, but as tensions between the Muricans and Liblanders begin to rise once again turmoil appears to lie around the corner. Will the President, who had been ruling via decree of a continued State of Emergency for decades, prevail in calming the masses, or will the once mighty empire be fractured, allowing opportunity to those who dare to take it? The endless quarterly profit goals of corporations largely drove the rise of the accelerated pre-disaster development, but even with the total destruction of all advanced technology, the corporate elite were ready to weather the storm. Now that the storm has finally lifted, or at least reached the eye, the Board begins to wonder if the common people would be better off under the total unregulated rule of corporate overlords rather than a failed federation, and more importantly what this could mean for their shareholders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_NAME_105115;European Union;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_105115;The many countries of the decentralized  European Union with full council authority grow restless with the dawn of this new dark age. Is greater authority needed to keep the peace and prevent the outer empires from encroaching on the continent, or is true independence for many of the member states on the horizon as a new age of feudal realms is ushered in? With the threat of the Eurasian Khan at the alliance's eastern borders, the decision may have more impact on the balance of Earth than their ambitious policial leaders realize.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_NAME_107175;Cyborg of Eurasia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_107175;When the Cyborgs and their Spacer subservience first descended from the Himalayan space elevator, which China owned, China was surprised to learn these beings were from a very literal Celestial Empire, seemingly ruled by the literal Jade Emperor of legends that China's own Emperors had always spoke of being descended from. China, soon found itself taken under the wing of their long lost family, gaining unimagined technological wonders, knowledge, and security at the cost of agreeing to pay tribute and to help the Celestial in battle. Soon they grew to posses a larger portion of Eursia and declared themselves the new Khanate after venturing into the Steppe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#ERA_CHAR_NAME_101105;Catholics of Brazil;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#ERA_CHAR_INFO_101105;Shattered in the wake of the Great Disaster, the independent realms of the once sprawling Latin nation have many opportunities from the varied geography within the six major regions of the land. Can the nation of Brazil be restored to it's true borders, or will the many nation states and tribes prevail in dividing the land until foreign influence looms at our door. As the Pope signals a new era of Crusades the answer could lie in the influence gained by the brilliance of a military commander.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_NAME_104265;Kemetics of Mercury;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_104265;Deep in the Upper Nile of Egypt lies a seemingly endless ornate tunnel. The Nile of Mercury contains a mysteriously similar tunnel, and the tribal inhabitants of the nearby great deserts still follow the ancient ways of the Kemetic pagan gods. Shortly after the arrival of the Celestial Space Fleet the endless tunnel suddenly transformed into a seemingly liquid mirror, only the other side seemed to be a continuation of the surrounding environment but with an abrupt change at the boundary. On closer inspection, it was in fact a Jump Gate that had been reactivated, a stabilized a hole punched in the very fabric of space itself between the separate Nile regions on Earth and Mercury. Will the tribes of Mercury's expansive deserts bring Kemetic control back to Egypt, or will the Sunni venture forth to the desert planet in a new era of holy wars?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#ERA_CHAR_NAME_101415;The United Corporations of America;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#ERA_CHAR_INFO_101415;The endless quarterly profit goals of corporations largely drove the rise of the accelerated pre disaster development, but even with the total destruction of all advanced technology, the corporate elite were ready to weather the storm. Now that the storm has finally lifted, or at least reached the eye, with the United States and European Union miraculously intact, the Board begins to wonder if the common people would be better off under the total unregulated rule of corporate overlords rather than a failed federation, and more importantly what this could mean for their shareholders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#ERA_CHAR_NAME_;Dark Side of the Moon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#ERA_CHAR_INFO_;In the fractured political landscape of the inhabitable side of the moon, the Kennedy Clone Dynasty rules a small, volatile nation state decades after the infamous Lunar Rebellion that shattered the colonies. At its helm reigns the "chosen" cloneline of Jack, with clonelines of the original Jack's father JFK, and brother Junior overseeing key provinces. Their realm is plagued by instability due to the new clone heir not being a perfect copy due to cloning defects, threatening their claim to power. Adding to the tension, the elder Marilyn Monroe clone vanished years ago, and rumors suggest she now leads a nearby pagan Lunist tribe. This fragile state must navigate pagan savages, rival lunar colonies, a persistent United States outpost, and the ever-present threat of internal strife.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
