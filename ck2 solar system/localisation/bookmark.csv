BM_WP;Feudal Solar System;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_WP_INFO;Long ago, Earth went dark on the same day all existing electronics in the Solar System stopped working. All ships not in orbit fell from the sky. Humanity quickly descended into chaos as society collapsed, bringing on a new Dark Age. Most of the population succumbed to famine as governments broke down and nations fractured. Around 1000 years later the Earth and other nearby terraformed worlds are recovering and have entered a new Medieval Era, largely forgetting the accurate history of humanity and the disaster. Knowledge of the off-world colonies has faded into myths and legends, until one day a derelict ship, carrying a strange elongated race that cannot survive in the gravity well of a planet's surface, arrived in orbit, offering to transport the humans of the many worlds of the Solar System on trips of conquest to nearby planets in exchange for basic supplies and goods. This technologically advanced but politically neutral faction, which had voyaged from the neighboring star system of Tau Ceti in a generational colony ship, would eventually become known as the Spacer's Guild.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

This technologically advanced but politically neutral faction, which had voyaged from the neighboring star system of Tau Ceti in a generational colony ship, would eventually become known as the Spacer's Guild to the native rulers of the Solar System and would hold a monopoly on the services of interplanetary travel, cybernetic augmentation, and cloning for many centuries, leading to a system where ground warfare is common between the many habitable worlds yet no aerial combat occurs between space fairing vessels that transport the troops.;;;;;;;;;;;;;xx


#ERA_CHAR_NAME_102265;Do not start as this character.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#ERA_CHAR_INFO_102265;Instead of pressing Start Game, choose Custom Game Setup at the bottom middle of your screen followed by the Random World button near the top right between the start year and the Merchant Republic list (Random World generation requires the Holy Fury DLC), or use the provided save file. The save file would need to be moved from the mod download directory to the CK2 save directory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_INFO_108275;The new update as of 3/8/2023 breaks old save files. If you wish to continue an old save file, visit our Discord server. This is the first test of a working bookmark for Solar System so that random world mode is no longer required. The number of cultures will be increased and borders for the various map modes will be adjusted, names within all map mode types are in development and subject to change. Province density and locations will be regenerated at least one more time which will break old saves again a future update. Please let us know on Discord if you have any feedback before the final map version is generated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
