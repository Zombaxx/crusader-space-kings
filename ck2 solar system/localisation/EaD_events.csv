EVTDESC_EADESCOIA_1;The local otherworlden population was far from happy about the new rulers. Rumor has it that in the otherworlden provinces, armed partisan groups have emerged that rob or slay tax collectors and merchant caravans, actively supported by the local population. As long as they are ruled by a human, the locals will create constant problems.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EADESCOIA_1;Damned unhumans!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_EADESCOIA_2;After the local inhuman population was driven out by our settlers, the otherworlden partisan groups finally lost support and were destroyed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EADESCOIA_2;Finally...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_EADESCOIA_3;Having accumulated enough strength, the local partisans openly challenged our rule! The rebels intend to establish their own independent kingdom by force, where their people will not be oppressed by humans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EADESCOIA_3;Damned unhumans!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_EADESCOIA_4;Having accumulated enough strength, the local partisans openly challenged our rule! The rebels intend to establish their own independent kingdom by force, where their people will not be oppressed by humans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EADESCOIA_4;Damned unhumans!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_EADESCOIA_6;Another army of otherworlden partisans rise up to reinforce the ongoing rebellion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EADESCOIA_6;Damned unhumans!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_EADESCOIA_8;After the accession of the ruler from their culture, the local otherworldly population finally calmed down. The partisan groups were disbanded, and their fighters returned to peaceful life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_EADESCOIA_8;Finally...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_EADESCOIA_11;The leader of the local partisans can accept our offer of autonomy, provided that you transfer rebellious province to his rule. In exchange, he promises to become your loyal vassal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_EADESCOIA_11;I hope that this will pacify the local population.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_EADESCOIA_11_NO;Actually, I have changed my mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
pissed_off_scoiataels;This can provoke a rebellion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_EADESCOIA_12;Local partisan agitators have seriously increased the level of hatred of the local population towards local human rulers, increasing the possibility of an uprising in one of our province.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x  
EVTDESC_EADESCOIA_13;Local partisans groups have increased their robbery in this province, attacking our merchants and tax collectors. We can hardly expect large treasury receipts from this province.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x  
EVTDESC_EADESCOIA_14;Local partisans groups have intensified their attacks on local militias and are actively cutting off supplies in the province. The passage of a large army through this province is fraught with heavy casualties.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_EADESCOIA_15;Local partisans groups have suffered serious casualties during clashes with the local militia. While their presence is still significant in this province, the partisans will not pose a serious threat in the next few years.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_EADESCOIA_15;[Root.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap] be praised!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_EADESCOIA_16;Local partisans groups have suffered heavy casualties during clashes with the local militia. While partisans is still exist in this province, it will take years for them to recover.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_EADESCOIA_17;It seems that under the influence of local partisans, the local population has renounced our religion in favor of their old beliefs. The efforts of our missionaries were wasted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EADESCOIA_17;Damned apostates!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_EADEM_3;A group of otherworlden settlers have begun settling in [From.GetName], while normally we could ignore the politics of the peasant rabble they have been gradually increasing their number to the point where they will outnumber the local population there! The otherwordeners are incredibly independent and it will be impossible to govern [From.GetName] unless we take action!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_EADEM_3;Let the settlers settle there, I never liked [From.GetName] anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x  
EVTOPTB_EADEM_3;Drive them out of our land!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x  
EVTOPTC_EADEM_3;Let them have this land, we can get rid of [From.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_EADEM_4;Otherworlden migrators have settled into one of our realm provinces, displacing the local population. As our liege is a otherworlden himself, there is little we can do about this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EADEM.5.desc;Our liege has decided to let otherworlden migrators settle into one of our provinces, there is little we can do about this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EADEM.5.a;Does he prefer these filthy otherwordeners over me?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
