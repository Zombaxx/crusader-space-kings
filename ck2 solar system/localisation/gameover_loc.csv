DYN1_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House Elyon, the Cyborg Emperors. Their rule has lasted on Ganymede in an unbroken line since before The 1st Great Disaster many millennia ago. Even if their isolationist policy due to the fuel reserves running out 1066 years ago and stagnant way of doing things have made them averse to change, keeping them from making progress, they are still without a doubt the rulers of the most advanced remnant of the Proto Civilization, which was kept this way for millennia partially thanks to their wise rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DYN2_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House Zeus, the dynasty that shaped Olypmus into the great Empire it became, and by extent influenced the entire post-disaster Western Mars. Under their rule Olympus would conquer Tharsis and vassalize the Kingdom of Alba. They would also organize the expedition for Valles Marineris which would not only extend the reach of Olympus further, but also be the final nail in the coffin for the Eternal Mechanism Empire of Ganymede, causing their rapid downfall and fragmentation. Truly the most influential dynasty in the era following the collapse of the proto-civilizations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
